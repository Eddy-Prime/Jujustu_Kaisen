                <p>Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.</p>

                <h2>Gojo Sealed</h2>
                <p>The curse user made use of that fact by walking out in the open, letting Satoru see him. As memories flooded the sorcerer's mind, he is trapped in the Prison Realm. Gojo recognizes whoever is standing in front of him as an imposter. Pseudo-Geto reveals his brain and explains that he coveted <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Prison_Realm" title="Cursed Spirit Manipulation">Cursed Spirit Manipulation</a> and that Suguru's body being left intact helped him. Meanwhile, one of Mechamaru's smaller puppets tries to contact Yuji.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

                    <h2>Pandemonium</h2> 
                    <p>Mechamaru reports that Satoru Gojo has been sealed. Back at the station, Geto's body temporarily takes control over the imposter's right hand, prompting a brief discussion on the connection of the body and soul with Mahito. Pseudo-Geto commands the Prison Realm to close and with that, Satoru Gojo is sealed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mechamaru confirms that he was killed by the patch face curse, clarifying that Yuji is only talking with a contingency he had created beforehand. As curse users head to the Mei Mei Team's location, Itadori is tasked with informing everyone on Gojo's status. Knowing that the fate of the jujutsu world is at stake, Yuji heads out. In the meantime, the Prison Realm is brought down to the floor as Satoru puts his faith in everyone.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
